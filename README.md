# markdown-resume

A tool that uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) to generate a good looking CV in .pdf and .html formats from a vanilla markdown file.

You can see a real-world CV built with the tool [**HERE**](CV_Jacek_Krolikowski_en.pdf).

Supports working with multiple markdown files at the same time (if, for example, you need your CV in multiple languages), and doesn't depend on jekyll nor LaTeX.

Absolutely no dependencies if you use GitHub CI to build the resulting files!. Just put your resume markdown file under `src/`, commit and push. You'll find a zip file with the output files in the [CI workflow summary page](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact#where-does-the-upload-go).

## Usage

Create a markdown file under [`src/`](src/) - on build it will be used to generate the corresponding .pdf and .html files under [`output/`](output/)

You can use [`src/sample.md`](src/sample.md) for reference and [`output/sample.pdf`](output/sample.pdf) to see what it generates. Most of it should be self-explanatory. Other than that:

- The `title` variable from the frontmatter gets set as the first `h1` in the content
- The `style` variable in the front matter chooses the style to use (from the [`styles/`](styles/) directory)
- Some markdown elements might have a special function in a given style (like the `h4` -> `code` used for time periods in the default style). Again, consult the samples to see how it fits together.

## Running locally

You'll need to install `pandoc` and `wkhtmltopdf`, optionally `lmodern` to use the default font. Afterwards just run `make`!

on Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install pandoc lmodern wkhtmltopdf
make
open output/sample.pdf
```

To have the output files automatically regenerated when you edit the source files:

```bash
sudo apt install pandoc lmodern wkhtmltopdf inotify-tools
make watch
```

The latter is Linux only, to use the same workflow on Mac, use the Docker workflow below.

## Running with Docker

If you have docker installed, you can run

```bash
make docker
```

While the docker container is running, the `src/` and the `output/` directories are mounted to it and pdfs will be re-generated whenever the markdown files are edited.

## Development

### Contributing

Contributions welcome! Especially new styles and tweaks to the default style.

### Creating a new style

Create a directory under `styles/` - the name of the directory will be the style name.
Any css files put in the directory will be included, in alphabetical order, in a resume compiled with that style.

### TODO

- [x] list out prereqs for the script to work locally
- [x] dockerfile for local compilation
- [x] CI with tests, compilation and output download
- [x] working style selection
- [x] multiple css files in a style (for vendored stuff)
- [ ] fontAwesome icons in the default styles
- [x] default style tweaks (link colors?)
- [x] add sample input / output files to the repo and gitignore
- [x] credit the projects that inspired this one
- [ ] add pdf metadata using exiftool?

## FAQ

### Why did you put [a pdf with your resume](CV_Jacek_Krolikowski_en.pdf) in the root directory?

It's the reason I created the project and I wanted to share the end result I was aiming for :)

Also, I'm available for contract work! If you have a project you think I could help you with, get in touch via the email in the [resume](CV_Jacek_Krolikowski_en.pdf), I'd love to hear from you.

### Why is there a hidden `.Makefile` in the root directory?

I left it as a reminder to never try to use hand-written Makefiles for anything non-trivial - it's not worth it.
